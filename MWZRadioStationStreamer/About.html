    Montgomery County Community College's student-run Internet radio station
    began as a student DJ club in Conshohocken in the late 1960s. The station
    first gained an audience in 1972, when it began broadcasting in the
    cafeteria after the College's move to Blue Bell. In 2003, the station
    began broadcasting on the Internet, and in 2008, Campus Radio Workshops I
    &amp; II were added to the Communications curriculum, resulting in more
    professional programing. Today, Montco Radio can be streamed
    internationally by clicking on the microphone icon in the lower right
    corner of the College's website or by using this app.
